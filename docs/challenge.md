# The Challenge

Junction 2026 challenge by Stoa, recorded as given.

Build a program that answers natural language questions about construction drawings and building information models accurately and verifiably.

Construction site engineers spend hours every day looking for information. General-purpose AI models frequently fail when analyzing complex technical drawings. This is one of the hardest unsolved problems in construction tech, and we want to see what a fresh approach can do with real data.

Create a program which answers natural language questions about construction drawings. You will get a dataset of real technical drawings in many formats and languages together with example questions. A great answer is correct and shows where in the drawing it came from so a human can verify it in seconds.

We are interested in solutions which next year's frontier models won't make obsolete. They can be, for example, hybrid solutions which combine frontier models, computer vision, 3D, geometry or small fine-tuned models.

## Judging Criteria

| Criterion | Weight |
|---|---|
| Accuracy of answers | 25% |
| How well the solution visualizes its reasoning so a human can verify the answer | 25% |
| Creativity | 25% |
| Low inference cost | 25% |

## Resources

Stoa provides a comprehensive dataset of real construction drawings and models.

## About Stoa

Stoa is building the AI-native operating system for construction, a $15 trillion industry, roughly 13% of the world's GDP. We are a Helsinki-based team with backgrounds at Supercell, AWS, McKinsey, Slush, Wave Ventures, SRV and Sensofusion, already working with several of the largest construction companies in the Nordics. We are backed by Lifeline Ventures, the founders of Wolt, Supercell, and SiloAI alongside two former Y Combinator partners & others. Stoa recently raised Finland's largest-ever pre-seed round.

We are at Junction because we want to see how Europe's best builders tackle the hardest challenges in the world's largest industry.
